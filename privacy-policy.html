            Baboo Stories (“we”, “us”, or “our”) is committed to protecting your

            “Services”). By using the Services, you consent to the practices
            described in this policy.

          </p>

          <p>
            We implement industry-standard safeguards, including encryption in
            transit, secure storage, and access controls. While no system can be

          </p>

          <h2 id="children">Children’s privacy</h2>
          <p>
            Baboo Stories is designed for parents and caregivers. We do not
            knowingly collect personal information directly from children. Any
            child-related information is provided voluntarily by parents to help
            personalise stories. If we learn that we have unintentionally
            collected personal data from a child, we will take steps to delete it
            promptly.
          </p>

          <h2 id="changes">Changes to this policy</h2>
          <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features, legal
            requirements, or feedback from our community. When we make material
            changes, we will notify you via the app or email and update the “Last
            updated” date above.
