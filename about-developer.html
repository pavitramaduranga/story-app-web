            I'm <strong>Pavitra De Silva</strong>, a solo app developer,
            storyteller, and parent who cherishes the quiet magic of reading to
            my child. When I couldn't find enough thoughtful, age-appropriate
            tales, I began writing our own nightly adventures‚Äîand that is where
            Baboo Stories took root.
          </p>
          <p>
            Today I'm shaping a calm, meaningful library for families like ours,
            where technology feels warm, intentional, and simply supports the
            connection you already have with your kids.

        <article class="card">
          <p>Hi there! I'm a solo app developer‚Äîand more importantly, a parent.</p>
          <p>
            Like many moms and dads, I love reading stories to my child. But I
            quickly realized that finding high-quality, age-appropriate stories
            was harder than expected.
          </p>
          <p>
            Research recommends reading five short stories a day to young
            children. You repeat the same five for a week and then rotate. That
            meant I needed around <strong>20 new stories every month</strong>‚Äîand
            most of what I found just didn't meet the mark.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I started writing my own stories‚Äîsimple, meaningful, and inspired
            by the tales I heard growing up. And just like that, Baboo Stories
            was born.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's a growing collection of carefully written, heartfelt stories
            made for parents to enjoy with their kids‚Äîjust like I do with mine.
          </p>
          <p>I hope these stories become a part of your special moments too.</p>
          <p>
            Your <strong>feedback</strong> and <strong>shares</strong> help me keep
            improving and building something truly valuable for families around
            the world.
